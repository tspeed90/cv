## Experience

### Workerbird

I worked a sprint with the Tech-for-Good startup, Workerbird, building a webpage introducing the company and product features. The project team consisted of two developers, the Co-Founder of Workerbird, and a designer. As part of the team, I was able to provide feedback to the overall design as well as specific ways to implement certain design features (ie. mobile-view hamburger menu, carousel).
